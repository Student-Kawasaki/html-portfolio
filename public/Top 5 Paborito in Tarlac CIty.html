<h3>1. Victor's - Inihaw na Tilapia</h3>
<p>I love to use my hands on eating this food. Adding soy sauce with crushed chili on the side will even make this food way yummier</p>
<h3>2. Bok's Chicken - Soy Garlic Boneless Chicken</h3>
<p>They have the best korean fried chicken. Their boneless chicken is rich in flavor even without bones</p>
<h3>3. Chong's Inasal - Chicken Inasal</h3>
<p>Best Chicken Inasal and Cajun Seafood in town. You won't get disappointed. </p>
<h3>4. Yoo Ja Ne - Samgyup Set Meal with complete Side Dishes</h3>
<p>Not eat-all-you-can samgyupsal but the quality is really good. I love to takeout from this restaurant cuz their side dishes are well prepared.</p>
<h3>5. Tessie's - Sisig</h3>
<p>It is a original kapampangan style Sisig. No mayo or egg. Just a simple chopped grilled pork with lots of diced onion on top. Simply the best sisig in town.</p>
