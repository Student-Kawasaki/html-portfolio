    <p>
      Over my nine-year tenure in a Japanese factory, I started
      by learning the basics and building relationships. In the later
      years, I took on a role as an assistant leader. I focused on
      improving processes, leading a team, and maintaining
      safety standards. My journey has been one of growth, from a
      beginner to an assistant leader in the factory setting.

  <h2>Tepanyaki Cook</h2>
  <h3>Yurakuen Japanese Restaurant
    Diamond Hotel, Manila Philippines<br/>
    2017-2018</h3>

    <p>Working as a cook and teppanyaki chef in a Japanese
      restaurant for one year, I gained expertise in traditional
      Japanese cuisine, developed teppanyaki skills, and excelled
      in customer service. I learned to manage time efficiently,
      adhere to culinary traditions, and work effectively in a team,
      all while prioritizing food safety and hygiene. This
      experience enriched my culinary knowledge and left me
      with a deep appreciation for the art of Japanese cooking.</p>

  <h2>Programming Student</h2>
  <h3>Udemy.com by Dr. Angela Yu <br/>July 2024 - Present</h3>
      <p>Over the past few weeks, my journey in programming with Angela Yu's course on Udemy has been both challenging and rewarding. As I near the end of section 4, Iâ€™ve noticed significant improvements in my coding skills. Concepts that initially seemed overwhelming are now becoming second nature, thanks to Angela's clear and structured teaching style. Each project has pushed me to think critically and apply what I've learned in practical ways. I'm excited to continue this journey and see how much further I can grow as I dive deeper into the course.</p>
